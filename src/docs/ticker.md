A ticker is a PixiJS object that runs one or more callbacks each frame.

```js
// Add a variable to count up the seconds our demo has been running
let elapsed = 0.0;
// Tell our application's ticker to run a new callback every frame, passing
// in the amount of time that has passed since the last tick
app.ticker.add((delta) => {
    // Add the time to our total elapsed time
    elapsed += delta;
    // Update the sprite's X position based on the cosine of our elapsed time.  We divide
    // by 50 to slow the animation down a bit...
    sprite.x = 100.0 + Math.cos(elapsed/50.0) * 100.0;
});
```
